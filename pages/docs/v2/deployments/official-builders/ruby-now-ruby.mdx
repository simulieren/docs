This builder takes in a Ruby program that defines a singular HTTP handler and outputs it as a serverless function.

## When to Use It

Whenever you want to expose an API or a function written in Ruby.

## How to Use It

Define a `index.rb` file inside a folder as follows:

```ruby
require 'cowsay'

Handler = Proc.new do |req, res|
    res.status = 200
    res['Content-Type'] = 'text/plain'
    res.body = Cowsay.say('hello world', 'cow')
end
```

Inside `Gemfile` define:

```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "cowsay", "~> 0.3.0"
```

And define a `now.json` like so:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [{ "src": "*.rb", "use": "@now/ruby" }]
}
```

## Rack Interface

Many Ruby frameworks interface with [Rack](https://rack.github.io/) for forwarding HTTP requests to web applications written in Ruby. You can use Rack with frameworks such as Sinatra or Rails.

Instead of defining a handler, write the application as usual, like this Sinatra application:

```ruby
require 'sinatra'

get '/*' do
    'Hello world'
end
```

Inside `Gemfile` define:

```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "sinatra", "~> 2.0"
gem "rack", "~> 2.0"
```

Add a Rack config file at `index.ru` to start the application:

```ruby
require './app'

run Sinatra::Application
```

And define a `now.json` like so:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [{ "src": "index.ru", "use": "@now/ruby" }]
}
```

## Using Rack with Rails

Rails creates a Rack config file `config.ru` in the root directory of the Rails project. Use this file in `now.json` and map the routes to that destination:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [{ "src": "config.ru", "use": "@now/ruby" }],
  "routes": [{ "src": "(.*)", "dest": "config.ru" }]
}
```

Most frameworks use their own implementation of routing. However, you can use a catch-all route to circumvent the framework and instead use the [Now Routing Layer](/docs/v2/deployments/routes) to match a route to a serverless function.

## Technical Details

### Entrypoint

The entrypoint file must be a `.rb` source file with one of the following variables defined:

- `Handler` proc that matches the `do |req, res|` signature
- `Handler` class that inherits from the `WEBrick::HTTPServlet::AbstractServlet` class

Alternatively, a `.ru` Rack config file will serve the Ruby application it contains.

### Version

Ruby 2.5.3 is used.

### Dependencies

This builder supports installing dependencies defined in the `Gemfile`. Alternatively, dependencies can be vendored with the `bundler install --deployment` command (useful for gems that require native extentions). In this case, dependencies are not built on deployment.

### Maximum Lambda Bundle Size

To help keep cold boot times low, the [maximum output bundle size](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas#maximum-bundle-size) for a Ruby lambda is, by default, **`5mb`**.
This [limit is extendable](/docs/v2/deployments/builders/overview#configuring-output-lambda-size) up to **`50mb`**.

Rails, for example, requires `15mb` for an empty build.

<Example>
  <span>
    Example <InlineCode>maxLambdaSize</InlineCode> configuration:
  </span>
  <Code lang="json">{`{
  "builds": [
    { "src": "*.rb", "use": "@now/ruby", "config": { "maxLambdaSize": "15mb" } }
  ]
}`}</Code>
</Example>

export default withAmp(({ children }) => <Doc meta={meta}>{children}</Doc>, {
  hybrid: true
})
